# PyBrute

A very short script that generates passwords combinations using words the user entered.

I made this script for a school project using Pycharm.

When running the script you will be prompted to enter different personal information about people. Then the script will ask you which words you want to exclude from the list of words (on purpose to take less time for the generation).
Be aware: the script will take a long time to generate every combination. Using the information of two people you easily get more than 100M lines...
